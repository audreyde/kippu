kippu: a simple travel planning tool.

## Installation
`git clone git@github.com:audreyde/kippu.git`

## Usage
Run `npm run dev` to start the project.

## Motivation
Recently I was planning a trip to Taiwan. It would be my first time planning a trip from start to finish on my own, but I had no idea where to start. Asking my friends, I realized almost everyone uses some combination of random googling, Instagram, and either a Google Doc or the Notes app to plan their trip. I wanted a tool whose sole focus is travel planning, designed specifically to make planning a trip easier. 

Additionally, this project presents me with an opportunity to learn Svelte, as well as practice making an interactive webpage. In the future, I hope to leverage an LLM to provide travel recommendations and optimize itineraries.

## Tech
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
